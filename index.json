From AI assistants that can write our emails and do our homework for us to reinvigorated conversations about AGI and what it means to be conscious, LLMs have truly transitioned to center stage in the year 2023. Heck, LLMs can even write blog post introductions: ‚ÄúIn this post, we‚Äôll look at an example of how LLMs can be leveraged to extract knowledge, glean insights and engage interactive dialogues with repositories of information, such as academic papers and legal documents.‚Äù.

How, then, do people communicate with computers? From low-level languages like assembly to high-level abstractions like Python, computer science has produced a number of different paradigms that enable just that. We call them programming languages. But the extent to which programming languages enable ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù is restricted. Namely, communications to the machine are required to follow strict rules (syntax) in order to be understood properly (interpreted or compiled) and any communication from the machine must first have been explicitly instructed by the programmer. So, how on earth do applications like ChatGPT exist?!\nEnter natural language processing (NLP) and LLM pipelines. The goal of NLP is to endow a machine with the ability to understand and utilize natural language, that is: the means by which we communicate with other people (plain old English, for example). This is a tall ask, but modern frameworks like LangChain and Haystack put it within reach for those with some Python experience and minimal exposure to concepts in modern NLP. In the following sections, we‚Äôll explore some foundational NLP \u0026amp; LLM concepts, along with Haystack and LangChain building blocks, all directed towards the aim of developing applications that enable us to chat with our documents. Everything we do is based on open source technologies and can be run entirely locally. That means, no sending your data to APIs and no paywalls!\n\rChaining Frameworks: Haystack \u0026amp; LangChain It‚Äôs never been easier and never been less intimidating to build powerful NLP applications. Haystack and LangChain are part of a new wave of tools for interfacing with LLMs and related infrastructure that have made great advancements in abstraction. The rest of this post will be a mixture of high-level concepts, a little bit of theory and examples of how to implement those theories and concepts using these frameworks. So, let‚Äôs familiarize ourselves a bit.\nHaystack Haystack describes itself as an ‚Äúopen source Python framework by deepset for building custom apps with large language models ‚Äú. It utilizes three main types of objects:\n Components or Nodes: ‚Äúfundamental building blocks that can perform tasks like document retrieval, text generation, or summarization.‚Äù Pipelines: ‚Äústructures made up of components, such as a Retriever and Reader, connected to infrastructure building blocks, such as a DocumentStore (for example, Elasticsearch or Weaviate) to form complex systems.‚Äù Agents: makes use of tools (like pipeline components or whole pipelines) to resolve complex tasks.     For our purposes, we‚Äôll need only the first two. We‚Äôll talk more about each object we use as we come to it, but you can find, still, more info in Haystack‚Äôs documentation.\nLangChain Similar to Haystack, LangChain describes itself as ‚Äúa framework for developing applications powered by language models.‚Äù And the similarities don‚Äôt end there. They share very similar interfaces, as well. The analogous objects here are:\n Components: ‚Äúabstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction.‚Äù Chains: ‚Äúa structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks.‚Äù Agents: lets ‚Äúchains choose which tools to use given high-level directives.‚Äù  Again, we‚Äôll only be utilizing the first two, with more implementation details to come. Checkout LangChain‚Äôs documentation for more information.\n   Compare \u0026amp; Contrast Two frameworks with similar functionality and similar interfaces ‚Ä¶ naturally, the questions arise:\n ‚ÄúIs one ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than the other?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich should we use?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy are we using both?‚Äù.  If you like straight answers, apologies in advance because my honest takes are:\n ‚ÄúIt depends.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt depends.‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶","date":1692144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692144000,"objectID":"34e92b5496f9426b5877d4d1ebab418b","permalink":"https://bobbylumpkin.com/project/docs2chat/","publishdate":"2023-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/docs2chat/","section":"project","summary":"A CLI application for chatting with your documents, powered by Haystack and LangChain.","tags":["LLMs","Machine Learning","NLP","LangChain","Haystack","Deep Learning","AWS"],"title":"Docs2Chat","type":"project"},{"authors":["Boseung Choi","Sydney Busch","Dieudonne Kazadi","Benoit Kebela","Emile Okitolonda","Yi Dai","Robert M Lumpkin","Wasiur Rahman Khuda Bukhsh","Omar Saucedo","Marcel Yotebieng","Joe Tien","Eben B Kenah","Grzegorz A Rempala"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to view import publication metadata.
